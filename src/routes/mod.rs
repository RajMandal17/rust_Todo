// This module declaration makes the 'todo_routes' module available to other files in the project.
// In Java, this is similar to having a package with a class for controllers, e.g. 'package routes; public class TodoController { ... }'
// In Rust, 'pub mod todo_routes;' means you can use 'routes::todo_routes::function_name' elsewhere in your code.
// It helps organize route logic separately, just like Java keeps controllers in their own package.
pub mod todo_routes;
