// This module declaration makes the 'todo' module available to other files in the project.
// In Java, this is similar to having a package with a class, e.g. 'package models; public class Todo { ... }'
// In Rust, 'pub mod todo;' means you can use 'models::todo::Todo' elsewhere in your code.
// It helps organize code and keep model definitions separate, just like Java packages.
pub mod todo;
